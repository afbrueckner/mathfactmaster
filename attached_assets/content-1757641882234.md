Game 11, p. 48 (Derived Fact Strategies - Addition and Subtraction)

Game Goal: Make sums as close to 13 as possible to get the lowest score.

Materials: 0-10 deck of cards (or 0-13 deck of cards); Lucky 13 player game mat, one recording sheet and one dry-erase marker per player

# How to Play (2-4 players):

1. Each player is dealt four cards face up on their player mat. Each player picks two cards which, when added together, produces a sum as close to 13 as possible.

2. Players record the sum of their cards on their recording sheet.

3. Players determine how far their sum is away from “Lucky $1 3 ^ { \\prime \\prime }$ and record that difference on the recording sheet.

4. The players’ score for each round is the difference between their sum and 13. For example: Player 1 chooses the cards 6 and 5 for a sum of 11. Player 2 chooses 9 and 6 for a sum of 15. Both players have a difference of 2 (13-11 and 15-13) and score 2 for this round.

5. Players discard all their cards, and the dealer gives each player four new cards.

6. Play repeats for five rounds. Then, players add up their scores from all five rounds. The


player with the lowest score wins.

# Game in Action:

This player chose 6 and 5 because the sum is closest to 13. $6 + 5 = 1 1$ , $1 3 - 1 1 = 2$ .

The difference is 2, so they have 2 points for round 1.

# Variations:

Play with 5 cards each round (game mat provided).

Change the lucky number. Recording sheet available.

Use any combination of cards to add to 13.

Change to subtraction with a lower lucky number (e.g., 3). Recording sheet available.

Change to multiplication with a greater lucky number (e.g., 24). Recording sheet available.
